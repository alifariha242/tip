Submitted by: Fariha Mohamed
Time Spent: 4 hours total 
## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [ ] User can enter a bill amount, choose a tip percentage, and see the tip and total values.
* [ ] User can select between tip percentages by tapping different values on the segmented control and the tip value is updated accordingly

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [ ] UI animations
* [ ] Remembering the bill amount across app restarts (if <10mins)
* [ ] Using locale-specific currency and currency thousands separators.
* [ ] Making sure the keyboard is always visible and the bill amount is always the first responder. This way the user doesn't have to tap anywhere to use this app. Just launch the app and start typing.

## Notes

After figuring out the basics of this app I tried running it and while it built successfully, something went wrong during runtime. I went through each line of my 
code trying to look for errors but I couldn't find any. While it read that there were no runtime errors I still couln't see anything on the simulator besides a 
white screen. After checking out the Hacking with Swift website I was able to figure out that my code had breakpoints that made the program stop running. Once I 
removed these break points, my app was able to run successfully without any hiccups.
